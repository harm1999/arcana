    "\t\"Controller\": '''The controller stereotype in object-oriented design encompasses objects or classes that play a pivotal role in decision-making and orchestration of actions within a system. To determine whether a method in a class aligns with the controller stereotype, one should consider the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision-Making Responsibility:**\n",
    "   - A method within the controller should primarily focus on making decisions rather than performing subsequent actions directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collaboration with Others:**\n",
    "   - Controllers collaborate with other objects or classes to gather information necessary for decision-making and to delegate specific actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initiation and Sequencing:**\n",
    "   - Methods within controllers often initiate and control a cycle of action. They may involve repetitive cycles with conditional branching logic or respond to specific events or circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Delegation of Actions:**\n",
    "   - The ultimate responsibility for accomplishing actions is often delegated to other objects or classes with more specific responsibilities, which are managed by the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **System-Wide Activity Control:**\n",
    "   - Controllers can be responsible for initiating and controlling ongoing system-wide activities or iterating over minor application tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Event-Driven Behavior:**\n",
    "   - Methods within controllers might be triggered by events or circumstances, allowing them to respond to changes in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Independence from User Directives:**\n",
    "   - Controllers are not limited to responding solely to user directives; they can be involved in managing various parts of an application, initiating, sequencing, and possibly completing cycles of activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating a method against these characteristics, one can determine whether it aligns with the controller stereotype. If the method primarily involves decision-making, collaboration with other objects, and the orchestration of actions within a system, it is likely to exhibit the traits associated with the controller stereotype in object-oriented design.''',\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\"Coordinator\": '''The coordinator stereotype in object-oriented design encapsulates classes or objects that specialize in managing and facilitating communication between other objects within a system. Here are key characteristics that can be used to evaluate whether a method in a class belongs to the coordinator stereotype:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Reaction and Delegation:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators react to events triggered within the system.\n",
    "   - Methods within a coordinator class should primarily focus on delegating tasks to other objects or classes based on the events they respond to.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Passing:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators exist to pass along information between objects rather than performing the actual tasks themselves.\n",
    "   - Methods in a coordinator class should be primarily responsible for forwarding information and requests to other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connection Management:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators specialize in holding connections between objects.\n",
    "   - Methods should be geared towards establishing and managing connections or relationships between various objects in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Communication Facilitation:**\n",
    "   - A coordinator's main purpose is to facilitate communication and collaboration between objects.\n",
    "   - Methods should be designed to enhance communication channels and streamline the interaction between different components in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Traffic Cop and Managerial Role:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators act as traffic cops and managers within a system, ensuring smooth flow and coordination of tasks.\n",
    "   - Methods should exhibit managerial qualities, orchestrating the execution of tasks by other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Request-Service Pairing:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators often pair client requests with the desired services or objects capable of performing the requested service.\n",
    "   - Methods should involve the intelligent matching of client requests with appropriate services or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Name Conventions:**\n",
    "   - A coordinator's name might follow a convention such as ending with \"-Manager.\"\n",
    "   - Methods within the class should align with this managerial role, focusing on coordination and delegation rather than direct task execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Dynamic Context Establishment:**\n",
    "   - In certain design patterns, coordinators may respond to requests by briefly establishing an appropriate context before delegating to other objects.\n",
    "   - Methods may involve context setup or configuration before handing over the task to relevant objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Elimination of Hard-Wired References:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators prove their worth by eliminating the need for direct, hard-wired references between objects.\n",
    "   - Methods should contribute to the flexibility and maintainability of the system by avoiding tightly coupled dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating a method against these characteristics, one can determine whether it aligns with the coordinator stereotype and plays a role in managing, delegating, and facilitating communication within the overall system architecture.''',\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\"Structurer\": '''The structurer stereotype in object-oriented design pertains to a class or object that is responsible for organizing and maintaining relationships between other objects within an application. When evaluating whether a method in a class belongs to the structurer stereotype, consider the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relationship Maintenance:**\n",
    "   - The primary responsibility of a structurer is to maintain relationships between application objects. Evaluate whether the method is involved in establishing, modifying, or managing relationships between instances of other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Organization:**\n",
    "   - A structurer organizes and structures information by grouping objects in different ways. Examine whether the method contributes to the organization or structuring of information within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Object Pooling and Management:**\n",
    "   - Check if the method involves pooling, collecting, or managing objects. Structurers are often responsible for handling the lifecycle and storage of objects they organize.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collaboration and Connectivity:**\n",
    "   - Assess whether the method collaborates with other objects, especially those responsible for connecting to external databases or devices. Structurers may obtain objects through collaborations with external entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visibility of Objects:**\n",
    "   - A structurer needs visibility into other objects for a reason. Verify whether the method requires knowledge about and interaction with other objects within the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Complex Relationship Management:**\n",
    "   - If the method is responsible for maintaining complex relationships, it aligns with the structurer stereotype. This includes managing connections and constraints among related objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Additional Behavior:**\n",
    "   - While the primary focus is on relationship maintenance, consider whether the method exhibits any additional behavior such as tracking references, managing space, or providing other relevant information about the structurer's contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Permanence and Connectivity Rules:**\n",
    "   - Recognize that the rules surrounding permanence and connectivity between structurers and their parts may not be straightforward. Debate on composition versus aggregation may not always be conclusive; however, the method should contribute to maintaining the intended relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Business Object Relationships:**\n",
    "   - In many applications, business objects have intricate structural relationships. If the method deals with the structuring of complex relationships, it aligns with the structurer stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Content-Centric Perspective:**\n",
    "    - A structurer is primarily concerned with its contents. Evaluate whether the method's main focus is on the organization and management of the objects it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "When classifying a method as belonging to the structurer stereotype, prioritize its role in maintaining relationships between objects, and consider additional behaviors as secondary considerations. The method should contribute to the overarching goal of structuring and organizing information within the application.''',\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\"Information Holder\": '''The information holder stereotype in object-oriented design encapsulates classes or objects that are primarily responsible for acquiring, storing, and providing information. When evaluating whether a method in a class belongs to the information holder stereotype, consider the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Knowledge Management**: Information holder classes focus on knowing and managing specific facts or data. If a method's primary responsibility is to acquire, store, or manipulate information, it aligns with the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited Collaboration**: Information holders typically have limited collaboration with other objects, especially for obtaining the information they are responsible for. If a method interacts extensively with other objects to perform actions beyond information management, it might not strictly adhere to the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency Maintenance**: Methods within an information holder class should contribute to maintaining the consistency of the stored information. If a method modifies or updates information within the object and ensures its correctness, it aligns with the information holder stereotype.\n",

    "4. **Independence in Information Retrieval**: Information holder classes often retrieve information internally or from hidden helpers. If a method actively retrieves or processes information from external sources, it may not strictly adhere to the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Persistence Management**: In some cases, information holders are responsible for ensuring the persistence of their data. If a method involves tasks related to data persistence, such as saving or loading information, it aligns with the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Computation and Interpretation**: Information holders may go beyond simple storage and retrieval, sometimes involving computation or interpretation of the stored facts. If a method within the class performs calculations or interprets data, it remains consistent with the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Responsibility for Yielding Information**: Methods in information holder classes should be geared towards yielding information when queried. If a method primarily serves the purpose of providing information in response to requests, it aligns with the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Value Holding for Various Applications**: Information holder classes might be designed to hold values relevant to diverse application objects. If a method's purpose is to manage values that can be requested by various parts of the application, it adheres to the information holder stereotype.\n",

    "\t\"Service Provider\": '''The service provider stereotype in object-oriented design characterizes a class or object that serves as a specialized entity dedicated to performing specific computing services. To evaluate whether a method in a class belongs to the service provider stereotype, consider the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Work and Computing Services:**\n",
    "   - A method within the service provider should primarily focus on performing specific work or offering computing services.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specialized Responsibilities:**\n",
    "   - The method should handle responsibilities that require specialized skills or computations. It contributes to the overall functionality of the service provider by executing tasks that demand a distinct set of capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Single Operation or Activity:**\n",
    "   - Methods within the service provider should typically be designed to perform a single operation or activity on demand. Each method should have a well-defined purpose and contribute to the overall functionality of the service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simple Protocol for Defined Operation:**\n",
    "   - A well-designed method within the service provider should provide a straightforward and clear protocol for a specific operation. It should be easy to set up and use, ensuring simplicity in its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Factored Design and Specialized Behaviors:**\n",
    "   - Methods belonging to the service provider stereotype are often part of a highly factored design, where various classes contribute highly specialized behaviors. The method's purpose should align with the specialized nature of the service provider it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Configurability and Optional Features:**\n",
    "   - The method may facilitate optional or configurable software features. It supports the adaptability of the system by allowing users to add or remove entire classes of objects, thus configuring the product's features without directly modifying class behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By considering these criteria, you can assess whether a method in a class conforms to the service provider stereotype. If the method primarily focuses on specialized computing services, has a well-defined purpose, and aligns with the characteristics associated with service providers, it can be considered part of this stereotype.''',\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\"Interfacer\": '''The interfacer stereotype in object-oriented design encompasses classes or objects that play a crucial role in facilitating communication and interaction between disparate components within a system. To evaluate whether a method in a class belongs to the interfacer stereotype, one should consider the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Information Transformation:**\n",
    "   - Methods within an interfacer class should primarily focus on transforming information or requests between different parts of the system. They act as bridges that enable seamless communication and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boundary Responsibilities:**\n",
    "   - Interfacers are typically found at the boundaries of an object-oriented application. Methods within this stereotype are responsible for managing interactions with users, other programs, or external services, depending on the specific type of interfacer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collaboration Patterns:**\n",
    "   - Methods within an interfacer class may exhibit specific collaboration patterns. For example, user interfacers may collaborate with non-UI parts of the application to signal events or changes, while internal interfacers delegate external requests to objects within their neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation of Details:**\n",
    "   - Interfacers should encapsulate many details related to communication protocols, formatting, or conversion of information. Methods within an interfacer class are designed to hide complexity and provide a higher-level, abstract protocol to the interacting components.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Support for Two-Way Communication:**\n",
    "   - Depending on the specific design requirements, interfacer methods might support ongoing two-way communication with external entities. This could involve handling user requests, transmitting updates, or translating external events into messages for application objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Focus on Protocol Definition:**\n",
    "   - When evaluating a method for the interfacer stereotype, consider whether it contributes to defining the protocol to the outside world. Interfacers often play a role in shaping how the application communicates with users, other programs, or external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Responsibility for Bridging:**\n",
    "   - Interfacers act as bridges between the non-object world and the object world of messages and objects. Methods within an interfacer class should reflect this responsibility by managing the flow of information between different realms of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Stylized Dialogue (for User Interfacers):**\n",
    "   - In the case of user interfacers, methods may support a highly stylized dialogue between the user and the system. This could involve handling user input, displaying information, and managing the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "By assessing these characteristics, one can determine whether a method aligns with the interfacer stereotype and is effectively contributing to the role of facilitating communication and collaboration in the system.'''\n",

    "rs_description = '''* Controller:\n",
    "\t- Makes decisions and closely directs others' actions.\n",
    "\t- Objects that make decisions and direct the actions of others are controllers.\n",
    "\t- They always collaborate with others for two reasons: to gather the information in order to make decisions and to call on others to act.\n",
    "\t- Their focus typically is on decision making and not on performing subsequent actions.\n",
    "\t- Their ultimate responsibility for accomplishing actions is often passed to others that have more specific responsibilities for part of a larger task that the controller manages.\n",
    "\t- Controllers are responsible for controlling a cycle of action.\n",
    "\t- The cycle of action can either be repetitive, with conditional branching logic, or be initiated and executed once on detection of a certain set of events or circumstances.\n",
    "\t- Controllers can initiate and control ongoing system wide activity, or iterate over a minor application task.\n",
    "\t- Controllers need not be spurred to action only on behalf of user directives.\n",
    "\t- Controllers can be found and created for many parts of an application where a cycle of activity is initiated, sequenced, and sometime later, possibly completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Coordinator:\n",
    "\t- Reacts to events by delegating tasks to others.\n",
    "\t- Coordinators exist solely to pass along information and call on others to act.\n",
    "\t- Their focus is on holding connections between objects and forwarding information and requests to them.\n",
    "\t- Their job is to facilitate communication and the work of others.\n",
    "\t- Coordinators are the traffic cops and managers within a system.\n",
    "\t- Coordinators often pair client requests with desired services (or rather, objects performing a requested service).\n",
    "\t- A Coordinator's name might end with -Manager.\n",
    "\t- A coordinator's primary behavior is standing around until someone needed something, then helping to establish the connection between two objects that would collaborate to actually perform some useful function.\n",
    "\t- These coordinators proved their worth simply by eliminating the need to hard-wire direct references between objects.\n",
    "\t- In another common design pattern, a coordinator may respond to a request by briefly establishing an appropriate context, and then delegating a request to one or more objects within its sphere of influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structurer:\n",
    "\t- Maintains relationships between objects and information about those relationships.\n",
    "\t- Most applications organize and structure information and group objects in different ways.\n",
    "\t- Objects need to be pooled, collected, and managed.\n",
    "\t- Objects that are responsible for structuring and organizing must get the things they structure from somewhere.\n",
    "\t- The objects they organize may come into being through collaborations with other objects that are responsible for connecting to databases or devices outside the software.\n",
    "\t- objects being structured can be built up and added to the structurer as the application executes.\n",
    "\t- Responsibilities for retrieving, matching, and updating the structured information are also places to look for collaborations.\n",
    "\t- Some objects have responsibilities for maintaining complex relationships. These, too, are structuring roles. These structurers aren't responsible for maintaining pools of like objects but instead are responsible for managing connections and constraints among related things.\n",
    "\t- A structurer has visibility of other objects because it needs to know about them for a reason.\n",
    "\t- Similarly, an object being structured may need to know its structurer (but this is much less common).\n",
    "\t- The rules surrounding permanence and connectivity between structurers and their parts is rarely simple or straightforward. Debating whether a structuring object is a composition or an aggregation can sometimes be a wasted effort. The important point is that composition and aggregation are special cases.\n",
    "\t- Many structurers don't fit neatly into a compositional or an aggregational role. Networks of objects often coexist with complex interrelationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.\n",
    "\t- Structurers primarily maintain the relationships between application objects.\n",
    "\t- In many applications, business objects have very complex structural relationships.\n",
    "\t- A structurer doesn't do much; it is the contents that are of interest.\n",
    "\t- Structurers can be designed to do more than organize their contents.\n",
    "\t- A structurer could know when any content was last referenced, or how much space is left in the structurer.\n",
    "\t- When classifying an object as primarily being a structurer, think first and foremost about what relationships it should maintain between other objects and how it should do so, and secondarily what (if any) additional behavior might be appropriate and useful for it to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Information Holder:\n",
    "\t- Knows and provides information.\n",
    "\t- When an object is an information holder, it is primarily responsible for knowing facts.\n",
    "\t- Typically, it won't collaborate much with other objects except to acquire any information it is responsible for knowing. After it acquires its information, it may not need to ask for it again. Sometimes, even gathering its information is someone else's responsibility.\n",
    "\t- An information holder can be created fully formed and populated with what it needs to know. Its only real responsibility, then, is to hold on to and keep its information consistent.\n",
    "\t- Information holders can also answer questions by turning around or finding out information from others. They represent to the world that they know a fact when, indeed, they know it only by referring to a helper that is hidden from others' view.\n",
    "\t- Sometimes, information holders can be charged with additional responsibility for making their information persist.\n",
    "\t- Or they can compute instead of only holding on to uninterpreted facts.\n",
    "\t- Sometimes objects are created to hold values that can be asked for by many different kinds of application objects.\n",
    "\t- At times, it can be useful to create objects that are responsible for yielding information.\n",
    "\t- In procedural programming languages we have the ability to declare constant values. In object designs, information holders are an equivalent concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Service Provider:\n",
    "\t- Performs work and, in general, offers computing services.\n",
    "\t- Responsibilities that require specialized skill or computation can be organized into service-providing roles. Sometimes the member of a family of service providers are designed together, each member providing a slightly different means of accomplishing a specific task.\n",
    "\t- A service provider typically is designed to perform a single operation or activity on demand.\n",
    "\t- A well designed service provider provides a simple protocol to a clearly defined operation. It should be simple to set up and use.\n",
    "\t- Pure service providers often are the products of a highly factored design. Such a design consists of many classes of objects having highly specialized behaviors.\n",
    "\t- One reason to create service providers is to facilitate optional or configurable software features.\n",
    "\t- The argument for this design strategy goes something like this: It is easier to configure a product's features by adding or removing entire classes of objects than it is to add or remove class behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interfacer:\n",
    "\t- Transforms information and requests between distinct parts of the system.\n",
    "\t- Interfacers provide bridges between naturally disjoint parts.\n",
    "\t- They can act as a bridge between users and our software (user interfacers), between objects in other neighborhoods (internal interfacers), or between our application and outside services and programs (external interfacers).\n",
    "\t- User interfacers transmit user requests for action or display information that can be updated.\n",
    "\t- User interfacers typically collaborate only with objects in other non-UI parts of the application to signal events or changes in the information they display.\n",
    "\t- Internal interfacers provide outsiders a limited view into an object neighborhood. They convey requests to objects hidden from view.\n",
    "\t- An internal interfacer collaborates by delegating external requests to objects in its neighborhood.\n",
    "\t- External interfacers usually do not collaborate with many other application objects. They may delegate to service providers the responsibility to format or convert information that they push or pull from their external partners, but mostly they just encapsulate non-object-oriented APIs.\n",
    "\t- Interfacers are found at the boundaries of an object-oriented application.\n",
    "\t- Interfacers can be designed to support communications with users, other programs, or externally available services.\n",
    "\t- Interfacers can be designed to support an ongoing two way communication between some external entity.\n",
    "\t- Interfacers can be designed to translate external events or requests into messages fielded by interested application objects.\n",
    "\t- Interfacers can be designed to act as a narrow interfacer.\n",
    "\t- User interfacers typically support a highly stylized dialogue between the user and the system.\n",
    "\t- Interfacers are responsible for bridging between the non-object world and the object world of messages and objects.\n",
    "\t- When thinking about interfacer design, focus first on those objects that the rest of the applications think of as defining the protocol to the outside world.\n",
    "\t- Many details can and should be encapsulated by these interfacers. The key is to hide details and provide a sufficiently abstract protocol.\n",
