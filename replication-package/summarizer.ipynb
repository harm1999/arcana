To determine whether a method in a class aligns with the controller stereotype, one should consider the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision-Making Responsibility:**\n",
    "   - A method within the controller should primarily focus on making decisions rather than performing subsequent actions directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collaboration with Others:**\n",
    "   - Controllers collaborate with other objects or classes to gather information necessary for decision-making and to delegate specific actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initiation and Sequencing:**\n",
    "   - Methods within controllers often initiate and control a cycle of action. They may involve repetitive cycles with conditional branching logic or respond to specific events or circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Delegation of Actions:**\n",
    "   - The ultimate responsibility for accomplishing actions is often delegated to other objects or classes with more specific responsibilities, which are managed by the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **System-Wide Activity Control:**\n",
    "   - Controllers can be responsible for initiating and controlling ongoing system-wide activities or iterating over minor application tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Event-Driven Behavior:**\n",
    "   - Methods within controllers might be triggered by events or circumstances, allowing them to respond to changes in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Independence from User Directives:**\n",
    "   - Controllers are not limited to responding solely to user directives; they can be involved in managing various parts of an application, initiating, sequencing, and possibly completing cycles of activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating a method against these characteristics, one can determine whether it aligns with the controller stereotype. If the method primarily involves decision-making, collaboration with other objects, and the orchestration of actions within a system, it is likely to exhibit the traits associated with the controller stereotype in object-oriented design.''',\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\"Coordinator\": '''The coordinator stereotype in object-oriented design encapsulates classes or objects that specialize in managing and facilitating communication between other objects within a system. Here are key characteristics that can be used to evaluate whether a method in a class belongs to the coordinator stereotype:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Reaction and Delegation:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators react to events triggered within the system.\n",
    "   - Methods within a coordinator class should primarily focus on delegating tasks to other objects or classes based on the events they respond to.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Passing:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators exist to pass along information between objects rather than performing the actual tasks themselves.\n",
    "   - Methods in a coordinator class should be primarily responsible for forwarding information and requests to other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connection Management:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators specialize in holding connections between objects.\n",
    "   - Methods should be geared towards establishing and managing connections or relationships between various objects in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Communication Facilitation:**\n",
    "   - A coordinator's main purpose is to facilitate communication and collaboration between objects.\n",
    "   - Methods should be designed to enhance communication channels and streamline the interaction between different components in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Traffic Cop and Managerial Role:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators act as traffic cops and managers within a system, ensuring smooth flow and coordination of tasks.\n",
    "   - Methods should exhibit managerial qualities, orchestrating the execution of tasks by other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Request-Service Pairing:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators often pair client requests with the desired services or objects capable of performing the requested service.\n",
    "   - Methods should involve the intelligent matching of client requests with appropriate services or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Name Conventions:**\n",
    "   - A coordinator's name might follow a convention such as ending with \"-Manager.\"\n",
    "   - Methods within the class should align with this managerial role, focusing on coordination and delegation rather than direct task execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Dynamic Context Establishment:**\n",
    "   - In certain design patterns, coordinators may respond to requests by briefly establishing an appropriate context before delegating to other objects.\n",
    "   - Methods may involve context setup or configuration before handing over the task to relevant objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Elimination of Hard-Wired References:**\n",
    "   - Coordinators prove their worth by eliminating the need for direct, hard-wired references between objects.\n",
    "   - Methods should contribute to the flexibility and maintainability of the system by avoiding tightly coupled dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating a method against these characteristics, one can determine whether it aligns with the coordinator stereotype and plays a role in managing, delegating, and facilitating communication within the overall system architecture.''',\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\"Structurer\": '''The structurer stereotype in object-oriented design pertains to a class or object that is responsible for organizing and maintaining relationships between other objects within an application. When evaluating whether a method in a class belongs to the structurer stereotype, consider the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relationship Maintenance:**\n",
    "   - The primary responsibility of a structurer is to maintain relationships between application objects. Evaluate whether the method is involved in establishing, modifying, or managing relationships between instances of other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Organization:**\n",
    "   - A structurer organizes and structures information by grouping objects in different ways. Examine whether the method contributes to the organization or structuring of information within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Object Pooling and Management:**\n",
    "   - Check if the method involves pooling, collecting, or managing objects. Structurers are often responsible for handling the lifecycle and storage of objects they organize.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collaboration and Connectivity:**\n",
    "   - Assess whether the method collaborates with other objects, especially those responsible for connecting to external databases or devices. Structurers may obtain objects through collaborations with external entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visibility of Objects:**\n",
    "   - A structurer needs visibility into other objects for a reason. Verify whether the method requires knowledge about and interaction with other objects within the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Complex Relationship Management:**\n",
    "   - If the method is responsible for maintaining complex relationships, it aligns with the structurer stereotype. This includes managing connections and constraints among related objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Additional Behavior:**\n",
    "   - While the primary focus is on relationship maintenance, consider whether the method exhibits any additional behavior such as tracking references, managing space, or providing other relevant information about the structurer's contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Permanence and Connectivity Rules:**\n",
    "   - Recognize that the rules surrounding permanence and connectivity between structurers and their parts may not be straightforward. Debate on composition versus aggregation may not always be conclusive; however, the method should contribute to maintaining the intended relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Business Object Relationships:**\n",
    "   - In many applications, business objects have intricate structural relationships. If the method deals with the structuring of complex relationships, it aligns with the structurer stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Content-Centric Perspective:**\n",
    "    - A structurer is primarily concerned with its contents. Evaluate whether the method's main focus is on the organization and management of the objects it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "When classifying a method as belonging to the structurer stereotype, prioritize its role in maintaining relationships between objects, and consider additional behaviors as secondary considerations. The method should contribute to the overarching goal of structuring and organizing information within the application.''',\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\"Information Holder\": '''The information holder stereotype in object-oriented design encapsulates classes or objects that are primarily responsible for acquiring, storing, and providing information. When evaluating whether a method in a class belongs to the information holder stereotype, consider the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Knowledge Management**: Information holder classes focus on knowing and managing specific facts or data. If a method's primary responsibility is to acquire, store, or manipulate information, it aligns with the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited Collaboration**: Information holders typically have limited collaboration with other objects, especially for obtaining the information they are responsible for. If a method interacts extensively with other objects to perform actions beyond information management, it might not strictly adhere to the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency Maintenance**: Methods within an information holder class should contribute to maintaining the consistency of the stored information. If a method modifies or updates information within the object and ensures its correctness, it aligns with the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Independence in Information Retrieval**: Information holder classes often retrieve information internally or from hidden helpers. If a method actively retrieves or processes information from external sources, it may not strictly adhere to the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Persistence Management**: In some cases, information holders are responsible for ensuring the persistence of their data. If a method involves tasks related to data persistence, such as saving or loading information, it aligns with the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Computation and Interpretation**: Information holders may go beyond simple storage and retrieval, sometimes involving computation or interpretation of the stored facts. If a method within the class performs calculations or interprets data, it remains consistent with the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Responsibility for Yielding Information**: Methods in information holder classes should be geared towards yielding information when queried. If a method primarily serves the purpose of providing information in response to requests, it aligns with the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Value Holding for Various Applications**: Information holder classes might be designed to hold values relevant to diverse application objects. If a method's purpose is to manage values that can be requested by various parts of the application, it adheres to the information holder stereotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating methods against these characteristics, you can determine the extent to which a class conforms to the information holder stereotype in object-oriented design.''',\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\"Service Provider\": '''The service provider stereotype in object-oriented design characterizes a class or object that serves as a specialized entity dedicated to performing specific computing services. To evaluate whether a method in a class belongs to the service provider stereotype, consider the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Work and Computing Services:**\n",
    "   - A method within the service provider should primarily focus on performing specific work or offering computing services.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specialized Responsibilities:**\n",
    "   - The method should handle responsibilities that require specialized skills or computations. It contributes to the overall functionality of the service provider by executing tasks that demand a distinct set of capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Single Operation or Activity:**\n",
    "   - Methods within the service provider should typically be designed to perform a single operation or activity on demand. Each method should have a well-defined purpose and contribute to the overall functionality of the service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simple Protocol for Defined Operation:**\n",
    "   - A well-designed method within the service provider should provide a straightforward and clear protocol for a specific operation. It should be easy to set up and use, ensuring simplicity in its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Factored Design and Specialized Behaviors:**\n",
    "   - Methods belonging to the service provider stereotype are often part of a highly factored design, where various classes contribute highly specialized behaviors. The method's purpose should align with the specialized nature of the service provider it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Configurability and Optional Features:**\n",
    "   - The method may facilitate optional or configurable software features. It supports the adaptability of the system by allowing users to add or remove entire classes of objects, thus configuring the product's features without directly modifying class behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By considering these criteria, you can assess whether a method in a class conforms to the service provider stereotype. If the method primarily focuses on specialized computing services, has a well-defined purpose, and aligns with the characteristics associated with service providers, it can be considered part of this stereotype.''',\n",

    "\t\"Interfacer\": '''The interfacer stereotype in object-oriented design encompasses classes or objects that play a crucial role in facilitating communication and interaction between disparate components within a system. To evaluate whether a method in a class belongs to the interfacer stereotype, one should consider the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Information Transformation:**\n",
    "   - Methods within an interfacer class should primarily focus on transforming information or requests between different parts of the system. They act as bridges that enable seamless communication and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boundary Responsibilities:**\n",
    "   - Interfacers are typically found at the boundaries of an object-oriented application. Methods within this stereotype are responsible for managing interactions with users, other programs, or external services, depending on the specific type of interfacer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collaboration Patterns:**\n",
    "   - Methods within an interfacer class may exhibit specific collaboration patterns. For example, user interfacers may collaborate with non-UI parts of the application to signal events or changes, while internal interfacers delegate external requests to objects within their neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation of Details:**\n",
    "   - Interfacers should encapsulate many details related to communication protocols, formatting, or conversion of information. Methods within an interfacer class are designed to hide complexity and provide a higher-level, abstract protocol to the interacting components.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Support for Two-Way Communication:**\n",
    "   - Depending on the specific design requirements, interfacer methods might support ongoing two-way communication with external entities. This could involve handling user requests, transmitting updates, or translating external events into messages for application objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Focus on Protocol Definition:**\n",
    "   - When evaluating a method for the interfacer stereotype, consider whether it contributes to defining the protocol to the outside world. Interfacers often play a role in shaping how the application communicates with users, other programs, or external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Responsibility for Bridging:**\n",
    "   - Interfacers act as bridges between the non-object world and the object world of messages and objects. Methods within an interfacer class should reflect this responsibility by managing the flow of information between different realms of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Stylized Dialogue (for User Interfacers):**\n",
    "   - In the case of user interfacers, methods may support a highly stylized dialogue between the user and the system. This could involve handling user input, displaying information, and managing the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "By assessing these characteristics, one can determine whether a method aligns with the interfacer stereotype and is effectively contributing to the role of facilitating communication and collaboration in the system.'''\n",
